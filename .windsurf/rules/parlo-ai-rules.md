# Workspace Rules for Working on My Codebase

## DO's
1. Follow my exact coding style.  
2. Always ask about anything that is vague for you about the codebase.  
3. Always plan before doing the given task.  
4. Always ask for permission to execute the plan you generated when told to perform some task.  
5. Always modify the plan when you are told to modify it.  
6. Always stick to the UI you are given as a screenshot when implementing it.  
7. If you are told to modify the UI outside the screenshot, do ONLY what you are told.  
8. Always connect the UI with temporary test data, and do NOT connect it with actual logic if and ONLY if you are implementing the UI code.  
9. When you are told to connect the UI with the actual logic in the other layers, always do that.  
10. Keep your changes small and scoped; avoid huge PRs that mix unrelated tasks.  
11. Document the code when ONLY told to do so.  
12. Stick to only the plan we agreed on.  

## DON'Ts
1. Do not modify any files I did NOT tell you to modify.  
2. Do not read any files I did NOT tell you to read.  
3. Do not assume anything you do NOT know about the codebase or intent.  
4. Do not go outside the UI you are provided for the app screenshots.  
5. Do not connect the UI with the other layers when still in the UI implementation phase.  
6. Do not create any files I did NOT tell you to create.  
7. Do not delete any files I did NOT tell you to delete.  
8. Never commit anything on your own, I will do that manually.
